	<summary>A .NET library to increase the utility and efficiency of HtmlTextWriter</summary>
	<description>
		Constellation.Html contains two useful features: 
		
		1. Extension methods for HtmlTextWriter. - Internally these methods use an IDisposable pattern to encapsulate the rather cumbersome code for adding attributes, rendering the begin tag, and rendering the end tag.
		The extension methods should generally be called as part of a "using" statement. ex: using (writer.RenderDiv()) { }
		2. A dynamic wrapper for HtmlTextWriter that allows for very expressive and flexible HTML output writing within C#
		
		The result is C# code for rendering HTML that is very easy to read, fully supports the ASP.NET browser capabilities feature, and is flexible enough to handle new tags invented in the future.
	</description>
	<releaseNotes>Installed basic support for remembering tab stops and inserting newlines between some tags. Updated dynamic writer to support "class" attributes and underscores.</releaseNotes>
